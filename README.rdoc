= CSV Rendering

just a stub of code for rendering CSV from controller, designed for use in conjunction with yui_datatable plugin (so you can render a csv with the same contents as a data table normally rendered in html/json)
	
For Example:
	
	render_data_table_as_csv(BlogPostsDatatable.new(self), BlogPosts.find(:all))
